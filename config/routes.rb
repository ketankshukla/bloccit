  #Comment this out because we've declared the index view as the root view below

  #commented out the line below so the users just have to type /about instead of
  #/welcome/about
  #get 'welcome/about'
  get 'about' => 'welcome#about'



  #The following line is an implied hash
  #It could also be re-written as root({to: 'welcome#index'})
  root to: 'welcome#index'
